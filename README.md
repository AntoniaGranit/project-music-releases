This is the first bootcamp project made in React. It uses a static Spotify API of music releases from the spring of 2023. This was our second time working with APIs, made a bit different by the fact that we did it all in React.

### The problem
Our task was to recreate a Spotify-like app of music releases, and make the design as close to the original as possible. I wanted to go a step further and have the project look like Spotify, so I found Spotify's font and added a grey background to the album cards. Me and Malwina found React to be very difficult to wrap our heads around at first, as it's definitely more abstract than Vanilla Javascript. However, we could definitely see the benefits of working with this framework, especially when building larger projects. We did have some difficulty with mapping over the albums, and selecting the correct cover image sizes. The hover overlay and svg-icons were also a bit of a challenge, but we noticed that when we put our heads together we had an easier time than when we tried to solve these problems on our own.
